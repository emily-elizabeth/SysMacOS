# SysMacOS
 extends and system calls for macOS

This replaces the older "macOS" extends that were originally on here.

* FolderItem.Icon As Picture // gets the icon of the folder item and returns a picture
* SysMacOS.PostUserNotification // posts a notification to the user notification center
* SysMacOS.RequestUserAttention // bounces the dock icon, when your application is in the background
* Window.Resize // resizes the given window with animation
* MenuItem.SetAlternate // tags a menu item as being an alternate item for another menu item (Save, Save As, etc)

Icon, Resize and SetAlternate are extends methods
